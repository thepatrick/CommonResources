You can add more!\n\n![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsegal/atom-runner/master/resources/screenshot-1.png)\n\n## Using\n\n* Hit Ctrl+R (Alt+R on Win/Linux) to launch the runner for the active window.\n* Hit Ctrl+Shift+R (Alt+Shift+R on Win/Linux) to run the currently selected\n  text in the active window.\n* Hit Ctrl+Shift+C to kill a currently running process.\n* Hit Escape to close the runner window.\n\n## Features\n\n* A docked runner window with ANSI support and ESC keybinding to close.\n* PATH and environment variable detection on OSX.\n* Shebang executable detection in all source files.\n* Configurable commands based on file scope or filename matches.\n* Execute unsaved file buffers!\n\n## Configuring\n\nThis package uses the following default configuration:\n\n```cson\n'runner':\n  'scopes':\n    'coffee': 'coffee'\n    'js': 'node'\n    'ruby': 'ruby'\n    'python': 'python'\n    'go': 'go run'\n    'shell': 'bash'\n    'powershell': 'c:\\\\windows\\\\sysnative\\\\windowspowershell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe -noninteractive -noprofile -c -'\n  'extensions':\n    'spec.coffee': 'mocha'\n    'ps1': 'c:\\\\windows\\\\sysnative\\\\windowspowershell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe â€“file'\n```\n\n**Note**: If a shebang is detected, that line will supersede the\n          default registered command.\n\nYou can add more commands for a given language scope, or add commands by\nextension instead (if multiple extensions use the same syntax). Extensions\nare searched before scopes (syntaxes).\n\nTo do so, add the configuration to `~/.atom/config.cson` in the format provided\nabove.\n\nThe mapping is `SCOPE|EXT => EXECUTABLE`, so to run JavaScript files through\nphantom, you would do:\n\n```cson\n'runner':\n  'scopes':\n    'js': 'phantom'\n```\n\nNote that the `source.` prefix is ignored for syntax scope listings.\n\nSimilarly, in the extension map:\n\n```cson\n'runner':\n  'extensions':\n    'js': 'phantom'\n```\n\nNote that the `.` extension prefix is ignored for extension listings.\n\n## FAQ And Known Issues\n\n### 1. I keep getting `spawn node ENOENT` errors. Why?\n\nAtom-runner relies on your `PATH` environment variable to run executables through your shell.\nIn order to correctly run executables, they must be in your `PATH`. In Mac OS X systems,\nrunning Atom.app from the Launchpad or Dock will not source your `PATH` directory additions\nfrom your `~/.bashrc` or other shell profile files, and you are likely not loading your\nfull set of paths into your environment. \n\nIn order to ensure that your `PATH` is correctly configured in OS X, it is recommended to\nload Atom only through an active terminal (i.e., the `atom` command).\n\n## License & Copyright\n\nThis package is Copyright (c) Loren Segal 2014 and is licensed under the MIT\nlicense.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lsegal/atom-runner/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/lsegal/atom-runner#readme","_id":"atom-runner@2.5.2","_shasum":"60bc575c1e92538f1b630238ea216bcfcc9ac77e","_resolved":"file:../d-116020-7790-1jxmbun/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116020-7790-1jxmbun/package.tgz"}
