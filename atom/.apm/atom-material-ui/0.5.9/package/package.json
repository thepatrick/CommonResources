Best with [Atom Material Syntax](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-syntax). (Mostly) works with other dark syntax themes as it uses syntax colors for the UI. Light themes work too, but doesn't look as nice.\n\nInspired by Mattia Astorino's [SublimeText theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).\n\n## Installation\n\nFire up a console and type:\n\n`$ apm install atom-material-ui atom-material-syntax`\n\nOr, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this package.\n\n## Buy me some coffee\n\n<a href='https://pledgie.com/campaigns/29552'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: Atom Material Design Theme and make a donation at pledgie.com !' src='https://pledgie.com/campaigns/29552.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' ></a>\n\n## Configuration\n\nAtom Material UI supports different accent colors. To change it, go to Settings > Themes and click the cog icon next to the theme selector.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/JB2iA5m.png)\n\nYou'll find the color dropdown there.\n\n## Screenshot\n\nHere's the obligatory screenshot. The toolbar on the left side is a package named [Tool-bar-main](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar-main).\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/2jNgkR9.png)\n\nAnimated tabs! (these animations can be disabled from the theme's settings)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/lUR3uRv.gif)\n\n## Extra\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/0tHORB1.png)\n\nYou can download the redesigned icon from [dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/115930/Atom-MD-Icon.zip).
