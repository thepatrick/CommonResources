Open **Sync Settings** configuration in [Atom Settings](atom://config).\n2. Create a [new personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) which has the `gist` scope and be sure to **activate permissions**: Gist -> create gists.\n3. Copy the access token to **Sync Settings** configuration.\n4. Create a [new gist](https://gist.github.com/) and save it.\n5. Copy the gist id (last part of url after the username) to **Sync Settings** configuration.\n\nDisclaimer: Github Gists are by default **public**. If you don't want other people to easily find your gist (i.e. if you use certain packages, storing auth-tokens, a malicious party could abuse them), you should make sure to **create a secret gist**.\n\n### Alternative **Sync Settings** configuration using Atom's config.cson\n\n1. Click on Menu \"Open Your Config\" to edit Atom's config.cson\n2. Use these keys:\n\n```js\n  \"sync-settings\":\n    gistId: \"b3025...88c41c\"\n    personalAccessToken: \"6a10cc207b....7a67e871\"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOpen the Atom [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette) where you can search for the following list of commands.\n\nBackup or restore all settings from the <kbd>Packages</kbd> menu or use one of the following **commands**:\n* `sync-settings:backup`\n* `sync-settings:restore`\n\nView your online backup using the following command:\n* `sync-settings:view-backup`\n\nCheck the latest backup is applied:\n* `sync-settings:check-backup`\n\nYou can also fork existing settings from a different GitHub user using the following command:\n* `sync-settings:fork`\n* In the following input field enter the Gist ID to fork\n\n## Running the tests\n\n1. Create a new [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) which has the `gist` scope and will be used for testing purposes.\n2. Export it with `export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN`\n3. Run `apm test`\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you're going to submit a pull request, please try to follow\n[the official contribution guidelines of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/contributing).\n\n1.
