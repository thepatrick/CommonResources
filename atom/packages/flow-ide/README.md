#### Differences to other packages

Differences to [facebook/nuclide][nuclide]
 - Nuclide is nice and all but it's mostly bloatware for lightweight flow programming

Differences to [AtomLinter/linter-flow][linter-flow]
 - It tries to manage flow servers by itself, I find it annoying

Differences to [nmn/autocomplete-flow][autocomplete-flow]
 - Never worked for me

Differences to [LukeHoban/ide-flow][ide-flow]
 - Outdated and buggy
 - No longer maintained
