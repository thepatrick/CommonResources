# Advanced New File package

## Please switch to Advanced Open File

Advanced New File is fork of existing package Fancy New File. First of all let me thank rev087 - author of Fancy New File for great work.
I forked this folder because old one wasn't maintained for few months and I couldn't contact the author.

Advanced New File is a package for helping Atom users to create new files and folders more easily.
It supports create new files and directory tree by typing a relative path with bash-like autocomplete support.

If you have any ideas or even better pull requests, please let me know :)
