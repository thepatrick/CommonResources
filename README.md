# Patrick's Common Stuff

Think of this repo as what some people might call dotfiles. It's the first thing I check out on a new computer and stores configs that should be common across all of them. Where possible config files allow including a file that is not included, primarily for things like "work computers are different just because".

## How I get started

### On a Mac

Grab `setup-mac.sh` & run it. (I've been known to do this by piping curl into bash. Don't hate me.) That'll take care of cloning this repo in to (my) standard place and running `setup-config.sh` script.

### On Linux

Manually clone the repo & run `setup-config.sh`

## How to apply updates

Run `setup-config.sh` again.
